On June 17, 2023, between 8:00 AM and 10:30 AM (UTC), our social media platform experienced a service outage that affected approximately 70% of all active users. The root cause of this outage was a network infrastructure failure caused by misconfigured network switches.

## Timeline:

8:00 AM: Users and internal monitoring systems reported a widespread inability to access the platform, indicating a service disruption.

8:05 AM: The incident was escalated to the infrastructure team for investigation and resolution.

8:10 AM: Initial investigations revealed network connectivity issues affecting multiple servers and regions.

8:15 AM: The networking team identified misconfigured network switches as the cause of routing problems, resulting in packet loss and disrupted communication.

8:45 AM: The misconfigured switches were promptly reconfigured to restore proper network connectivity.

9:00 AM: Testing confirmed partial service availability, with most users regaining access.

9:30 AM: Intermittent connection issues persisted for a subset of users, indicating a secondary misconfiguration related to network load balancing.

10:15 AM: The load balancing misconfiguration was addressed, resulting in the full restoration of service functionality.

10:30 AM: 100% of traffic was back online, and all users regained access to the platform.

## Issues: Cause and Resolution:

The service outage was caused by misconfigured network switches, which led to network connectivity issues and disrupted communication. The initial misconfiguration caused routing problems and packet loss. Prompt reconfiguration of the switches restored network connectivity, but intermittent connection issues persisted due to a secondary misconfiguration related to network load balancing. Addressing this secondary misconfiguration resulted in the full restoration of service functionality.

## Actions: Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To enhance platform reliability and prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures have been implemented:

Network Configuration Audits: Regular audits of network configurations will be performed to promptly identify and rectify misconfigurations. Network Monitoring

Enhancements: The network monitoring system will be enhanced to provide real-time visibility into network performance and facilitate early detection of connectivity issues.

Redundancy and Failover Testing: Regular testing of redundancy and failover mechanisms will be conducted to ensure effective handling of network infrastructure failures.

Incident Response Drills: Periodic incident response drills will be conducted to improve incident detection, response, and coordination.

Documentation and Knowledge Sharing: Lessons learned from the incident will be documented and shared to increase awareness and prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.

## Conclusion:

The service outage on June 17, 2023, resulted from misconfigured network switches causing network connectivity issues and disrupted communication. The issue was resolved within 2 hours and 30 minutes, with minimal impact on users. Through the implementation of corrective and preventative measures, we aim to enhance platform reliability, minimize the risk of similar incidents, and improve overall performance.
